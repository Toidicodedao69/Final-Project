		<h1>TOPIC INTRODUCTION - MIGRATION</h1>
		<p>The COVID-19 pandemic had created a significant disruption globally in every aspect of lives. As a result, millions of people lost their jobs, schools are closed, and cities are locked down, altering the socioeconomic flow of the world, and world migration is no better. Between 10 March 2020 and 28 February 2022, 122,823 movement restrictions were implemented around the world.  Assuming zero growth in the number of migrants between 1 March and 1 July 2020, it has been estimated that we have experienced a decrease of nearly 2 million international migrants compared to the expected increase between mid-2019 and mid-2020 (Migration Data Portal 2022). </p>
		<p>This visualization should be used by people interested in knowing how COVID-19 impacted Australia’s migration trend, including both experts who wants to gain specific insights on both overall and state specific migration data, or normal users who wish to explore the impact of the pandemic on migration.</p>
		<p>Having experienced the pandemic ourselves, our team worked on this visualization project to further investigate the impact of this virus on migration trends, particularly in Australia, overall, and its regions separately, before, during, and after COVID-19 (2017-2022).</p>

		<br>
		<p>This visualization shows the Net oversea migration in Australia from 2017 to 2022. Using the combination of 2 charts, a choropleth map, and a bar chart map. 
			The choropleth map shows the total Net overseas migration (after calculation) of every state after each year when the mouse hovers over each state. 
			You can also change the year by simply clicking the button. The choropleth map is simply a shortcut for you to understand the net overseas migration of each state. The bluer the state has, the higher net overseas migration that state has, and opposite
			And also when you click on each state, it gonna shows the top 5 countries that contribute to the total net overseas migration to the state in that year.</p>

		 <p>The chart has depicted the impacts of COVID-19 on the Australian's socioeconomy, therefore disrupting the migration pattern.</p> 
		 <p>From the chart, it can be seen clearly that during the two periods of 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 periods did not experienced any significant changes (as all categories fluctuated between 1-2%). During the 2019-2020 period, the distribution for visa types remains the same, except for visitors visas and student-higher education visa, with a 10% change of proportion from the student-higher education type to the visitor types.</p>
		 <p>Shifting from 2019-2020 to 2020-2021, we can see a major change in the pie slices' distribution. "Other temporary visa types" category rises greatly from just 6% in the 2019-2020 to 35.1% in 2020-2021. Along with that, the skilled temporary visa's proportion also increased significantly from just 7.3% in 2019-2020 to 30.3% in 2020-2021. Other visas types slices percentages slightly dropped, with the most noticable drop belongs to the student-higher education type with a 21.7% drop. This pattern can be ralated to real life events that impacted the migration pattern between 2020-2021, such as the Covid Lockdown period in early 2020, or the border closures and travel restrictions, not only in Australia but also around the world, along with school closures, which explains the huge drop for the student visa types, exspecially for the higher education sector. </p>
		 <p>2021-2022 period marks the significant decrease of COVID-19 level of impact globally thanks to vaccine distribution. Along with that, border's restrictions and lockdowns are slowly removed, which results in a significant rise in migration compared to the plummet of the previous period. This can be reflected in the percentage of Student-higher education visas, which rocketed to 40.4% in 2021-2022, showing the impacts of border and activities restart policies given by the Australian government. Again, this pattern can be referred from also the occupation of all student visa types proportion on the pie chart, which occupied more than half (57%), which can be explained by the policies that the Australian government applied to support incoming migrants to recover the economy, such as the visa refund policy in the early period of 2022.</p>
